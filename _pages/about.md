<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I  received my M.S. from the [VAI Lab](https://visualai.khu.ac.kr/home) at the Graduate School of AI, Kyung Hee University, where Prof. Jung Uk Kim was my advisor. <br>
I also received a B.S. in Software Convergence from the Kyung Hee University.

My work aims to address key challenges in <i>**multimodal learning**<i> and <i>**data-centric AI**<i>. 

In particular, I explore <i>**user-controllable video captions**<i> using large vision-language models (MLLMs + LLMs), and how to design <i>**robust detection systems under incomplete labels**<i> in multispectral data.
